# 🤖 Machine Learning: Classification, Regression & NLP

A curated repository of end-to-end machine learning projects demonstrating the application of **classification**, **regression**, and **natural language processing (NLP)** techniques using real-world datasets.

Each notebook showcases not just model training and evaluation, but also proper data preprocessing, visualization, and pipeline design—ideal for applying ML in practical environments.

## 📌 Key Features

- ✅ Supervised ML (Classification & Regression)
- ✅ Text preprocessing & sentiment analysis (NLP)
- ✅ Feature engineering and selection
- ✅ Model evaluation with precision, recall, F1, ROC-AUC, and MSE
- ✅ Clean and annotated Jupyter Notebooks
