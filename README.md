# Machine Learning: Classification, Regression & NLP

A curated repository of end-to-end machine learning projects demonstrating the application of **classification**, **regression**, and **natural language processing (NLP)** techniques using real-world datasets.

Each notebook showcases not just model training and evaluation, but also proper data preprocessing, visualization, and pipeline design—ideal for applying ML in practical environments.

## Key Features

-  Supervised ML (Classification & Regression)
-  Text preprocessing & sentiment analysis (NLP)
-  Feature engineering and selection
-  Model evaluation with precision, recall, F1, ROC-AUC, and MSE
-  Clean and annotated Jupyter Notebooks
